# MazeGenerator
Maze Generator is a project for Data Structure course | TCSS 342 | @the University of Washington Tacoma
<br/>
Maze Generator Program uses my own Graph Data Structure, and Depth First Search Algorithm.

## Description
This program uses to build the 2-dimension maze with no cycles, which is many gaming applications require. 
These mazes are then the target of maze-solving games or used by maze-solving algorithms. 
Thus, one problem is generating an extensive library of mazes to be used by the games or to test the algorithms. 
In addition, of course, algorithms exist to generate random mazes.

## Getting Started
- Build the graph data structure.
- Decide on the best implementation choices for the purpose.
- Implement a depth first search of a graph.
- Visualize the graph.
